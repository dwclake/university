  Quick sort was roughly 20% faster than merge sort when N = 1,000, 
10,000 and 100,000. When N was 100, quick sort took 1/10 the time that 
merge sort took. For all N, merge sort was significantly slower in case 
1 than the other cases, where were roughly the same. For quick sort, each 
case performed roughly the same except for when N = 100,000.
