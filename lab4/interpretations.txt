  Out of all the algorithms, bubble sort was the on average 4 times slower than the other two algorithms.
Case one and two were roughly the same for bubble sort, case three was the fastest, with case two in the 
middle. Selection sorts performance was almost identical for all cases. Insertion sorts performance
in case 1 was roughly 25% slower than the other cases, which were pretty much the same.
