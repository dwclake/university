## Array Sorting
Important features of an array a:
    - size N
    - type
Formal definition of a sorted array:
    - if and only if each element is less than or equal to the next element
    - a[i] <= a[i+1] for all i in 0..(n-2)
    - if sorted min(a) = a[0]
    - max(a) = a[n-1]
Can sort an array by moving the maximum of the array to the last element, the sorting the unsorted subarray
Vice versa with the minimum
```cpp
/* */
int a[];
int* a;
```
