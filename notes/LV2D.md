## IO
At the hardware level, I/O ports are used
  - 64k port addresses
  IO is typically done by calls to operating system routines because 
the instructions that access ports are unavailable in ordinary application programming
---
## Operating System
- Manages program execution
- Provides access to I/O devices
- Provide user interface
  - Command line interface (DOS, UNIX)
  - Graphical user interface (Windows, Gnome, macOS)
---
## Text Editors
- Used to create source programs or data files
---
## Language Translators
- Interpreters translates HLL code line by line
- Compilers translate HLL code to object code that is almost ready for CPU
- Assemblers translate assembly language, a low level language, to object code
---
## Linker
- Object code files are not quite ready for execution
- A linker combines object code files and prepares them to be loaded into memory for execution
---
## Debugger
- Allows programmer to control the execution of a program
- Lets programmer take a look at memory/register contents
---
## IDE
- Single interface provides access to text editor, compiler, assembler, linker, debugger
