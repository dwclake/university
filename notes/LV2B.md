### CPU's Function

- Fetch instructions from memory
- Decode instruction
- Execute instruction
- Store results

---
### Von Neumann Model

Fetch, Decode, Execute

---
### CPU Components

- Register - storage location
- Control Unit - coordinates sequence of execution steps
- ALU - performs arithmetic and bitwise processing
- Clock:
    - Synchronizes all CPU and BUS operations
    - Clock cycle measures time of a single operation
    - Measured in Hz
    - Clock is used to trigger events

---
### 32-bit CPU

- General purpose registers:
    - 8 32-bit registers
- Segment registers:
    - 6 16-bit registers
- Flags register:
    - Single 32-bit register, signals errors and the like
- EIP - Instruction pointer:
    - Single 32-bit register, points to next instruction to fetch
- FPU Registers:
    - 14 registers of varying width, used for floating point arithmetic
